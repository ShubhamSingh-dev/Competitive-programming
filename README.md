# 🧠 Competitive Programming by Shubham Singh ⚔️💻

Hey! I'm Shubham, and this repo is my personal arena where I battle logic, bugs, and TLEs — one problem at a time.

This isn't just about solving problems. It's about **growing every day**, building the mindset of a problem solver, and pushing my limits — starting from 800-rated problems and rising all the way up. 🧗‍♂️🔥

## 🎯 Current Focus

I'm on a mission to complete the **TLE Eliminator CP-31** challenge — a problem set crafted to destroy bad habits and teach real CP optimization.

- Currently grinding: **800-rated problems**
- Goal: Master speed, precision & efficiency
- Theme: No more TLEs. No more guesses. Just pure logic.
